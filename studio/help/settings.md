Every change on the Settings page is saved as soon as you make it.

The Create page starts from these values, and you can change them for each batch there. Batches already made keep
their own; change those with the **Output** button on the batch (see
[Batches](batches.md#change-speed-loudness-or-files-afterwards)).

## Folders

- **Batches** — where every batch's folder goes. **Browse** to choose another folder; the folder icon opens it in
  File Explorer. Running batches must finish (or be cancelled) before you move it.
- **Exports** — where AI agents save the exports they make.
- **Voices**, **Models**, **Logs** — open those folders.

See [Files and folders](files-and-folders.md).
